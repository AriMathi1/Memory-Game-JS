# Memory-Game-JS

A memory game is a card game designed to test and improve memory skills. The goal is to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions.


How to Play the Game?

Find and match all pairs of cards.
Flip two cards at a time by clicking on them.
If the cards match, they stay face up.
If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay.
Continue flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
